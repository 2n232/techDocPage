      <p>The <code>ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P</code> is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR
        enhanced RISC architecture. By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the
        <code>ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P</code> achieves throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz allowing the
        system designer to optimize power consumption versus processing speed.</p>
      <p>The AVR core combines a rich instruction set with 32 general purpose working registers. All the 32 registers are
        directly connected to the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), allowing two independent registers to be accessed in one
        single instruction executed in one clock cycle. The resulting architecture is more code efficient while achieving
        throughputs up to ten times faster than conventional CISC microcontrollers.</p>

      <header>About Code Examples</header>
      <p>This documentation contains simple code examples that briefly show how to use various parts of the device.
        These code examples assume that the part specific header file is included before compilation. Be aware that not
        all C compiler vendors include bit definitions in the header files and interrupt handling in C is compiler
        dependent. Confirm with the C compiler documentation for more details.</p>
      <p>For I/O Registers located in extended I/O map, <code>“IN”, “OUT”, “SBIS”, “SBIC”, “CBI”, and “SBI”</code> instructions must
        be replaced with instructions that allow access to extended I/O. Typically “LDS” and “STS” combined with
        <code>“SBRS”, “SBRC”, “SBR”, and “CBR”</code>.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Capacitive_Touch_Sensing">
     <header>Capacitive Touch Sensing</header>
     <p>The QTouch Library provides a simple to use solution to realize touch sensitive interfaces on most AVR
      microcontrollers. The <code>QTouch Library</code> includes support for the QTouch and QMatrix™ acquisition methods.</p>
     <p>Touch sensing can be added to any application by linking the appropriate <code>QTouch Library</code> for the AVR
      Microcontroller. This is done by using a simple set of APIs to define the touch channels and sensors, and then
      calling the touch sensing APIs to retrieve the channel information and determine the touch sensor states.</p> 
     <p>The QTouch Library is FREE and downloadable from the Microchip website at the following location
      <a href="http://www.microchip.com" target="_blank">http://www.microchip.com</a> . For implementation details and other information, refer to the QTouch Library User
      Guide - also available for download from the Microchip website.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Interrupts">
      <header>Interrupts</header>
      <p>This section describes the specifics of the interrupt handling as performed in
        <code>ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P</code></p>
      <p>The interrupt vectors in ATmega 48A/48PA, ATmega88A/88PA, ATmega168A/168PA and ATmega328/328P
        are generally the same, with the following differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each Interrupt Vector occupies two instruction words in ATmega168A/168PA and ATmega328/328P, and
          one instruction word in ATmega 48A/48PA and ATmega88A/88PA.</li>
        <li>ATmega 48A/48PA does not have a separate Boot Loader Section. In ATmega88A/88PA,
          ATmega168A/168PA and ATmega328/328P, the Reset Vector is affected by the BOOTRST fuse, and the
          Interrupt Vector start address is affected by the IVSEL bit in MCUCR.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="External_Interrupts">
      <header>External Interrupts</header>
      <p>The External Interrupts are triggered by the INT0 and INT1 pins or any of the PCINT23...0 pins. Observe that, if
        enabled, the interrupts will trigger even if the INT0 and INT1 or PCINT23...0 pins are configured as outputs. This
        feature provides a way of generating a software interrupt. The pin change interrupt PCI2 will trigger if any
        enabled PCINT[23:16] pin toggles. The pin change interrupt PCI1 will trigger if any enabled PCINT[14:8] pin
        toggles. The pin change interrupt PCI0 will trigger if any enabled PCINT[7:0] pin toggles. The PCMSK2,
        PCMSK1 and PCMSK0 Registers control which pins contribute to the pin change interrupts. Pin change
        interrupts on PCINT23...0 are detected asynchronously. This implies that these interrupts can be used for
        waking the part also from sleep modes other than Idle mode.</p>
      <p>The External Interrupts can be triggered by a falling or rising edge or a low level. This is set up as indicated in
        the specification for the External Interrupt Control Registers – EICRA (INT2:0). When the external interrupt is
        enabled and is configured as level triggered, the interrupt will trigger as long as the pin is held low. Low level
        interrupts and the edge interrupt on INT2:0 are detected asynchronously. This implies that these interrupts can
        be used for waking the part also from sleep modes other than Idle mode. The I/O clock is halted in all sleep
        modes except Idle mode.</p>
